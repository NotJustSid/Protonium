## Getting Protonium

Do note that the language is currently in development and the current versions are unstable. You can

- Download Protonium from the Github Releases <span class="label label-yellow">Coming Soon</span>
- Build it from [source](https://github.com/sid200/protonium) if you're up for it!

In the future, a standalone, custom development environment with tons of features might be available for Protonium. So all neophytes would need to do is get the installer, choose to install the language, and yeah that's it!

## Hello World!

Aight. So you got Protonium. The first thing you would want to do is print some text and enter the world of Protonium:

{: .code-example .verbatim}
Hello Protonium World!

```cpp
print("Hello Protonium World!");
```
